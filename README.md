# **Video Classification using Vision Transformer (ViViT) on UCF101 Dataset**  
  
- Implements a **ViViT-based** model for **video action classification**.  
- Achieves **91% accuracy**, demonstrating the potential of transformer-based architectures in video recognition.  
- Uses **self-attention mechanisms** to effectively process sequential frames.  
- Further improvements required, work going on.  
- Applicable in action recognition, surveillance & multimedia analysis.
